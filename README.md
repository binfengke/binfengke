# Hi, I'm Binfeng Ke

**QA Engineer** specializing in Web3 and blockchain applications.

I focus on building reliable testing frameworks for decentralized systems — from smart contract validation to wallet integration testing and on-chain data verification.

Target role: Web3 QA / SDET focused on Solana and dApp reliability.

## What I Work On

- **Smart Contract QA** — Designing test strategies for Solana/Anchor programs, including state validation and edge case coverage
- **API Testing** — Solana JSON-RPC endpoint testing with Postman/Newman, automated assertion scripts
- **CI/CD Pipelines** — GitHub Actions workflows for automated build verification and API regression testing
- **Web3 Integration Testing** — MetaMask, WalletConnect, NFT lifecycle, and on-chain/off-chain sync verification
